# Job-Wind - A Job portal website

## Introduction ##

* Looking for a new job is a complex dynamic process.
* Finding the "correct" applicant to call for job interviews is a particularly difficult challenge. 
* We plan to develop an improved online job portal site that gives job recruiters information to help them optimize their job applicant search approach. 
* This will specifically assist job recruiters in spotting suitable applicants. 
* It will provide suggestions to current job searchers regarding occupations. 
* We will create a variation of the site that takes their unique skills, abilities, and other personal traits information from job applicants into consideration. 
* As a result, we will also give job search assistance that is highly personalized and takes into consideration the job seeker's unique position.
